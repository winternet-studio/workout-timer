# Workout Timer

Workout timer for your browser with configurable workout programs, eg. a program for each day. Manages repetitions, rest, and sets. Also has quick timers with presets of different length.

Provides audible cues.

Requires a web server.

As is, it requires PHP. You could rename `index.php` to `index.htm` though, but you still need to run it through a web server.

## Usage

- Copy `config.sample.js` to `config.js` and adjust as necessary.
	- Add audio files to this folder and configure them in `config.js`
- Open the index file in a browser through a web server.
